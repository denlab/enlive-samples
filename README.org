#+TITLE: Enlive Samples
#+STARTUP: indent

* What's this ? 

  [[https://github.com/cgrand/enlive][Enlive]] is a great templating framework for Clojure, but it is also mind bending.

  enlive-samples tries to provide very simple examples, to be used as
  a starting point in other projects

* Running the project

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
   cd enlive-samples
#+END_SRC

** Get the dependencies: 

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
   lein deps
#+END_SRC

** Start a REPL: 

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
   lein repl
#+END_SRC

   or with emacs: 

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
   lein swank
#+END_SRC

** At the REPL: 

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(ns user
  (:require [net.cgrand.enlive-html :as html])
  (:use     [enlivesamples.sample3]
            [clojure.contrib.repl-utils :only [show]]
            [clojure.test :only [run-tests]]
            [clojure.repl]
            [enlivesamples.utils]))
#+END_SRC

** Now point your browser at http://localhost:8080

* Sample 1: Replace the content of a tag.

We will just replace the content of the tag with =id= message.

Here is a diagram of the sample 1 that tries ;) to explain how the
pieces work together.

* Sample 2: Replace the content of an attribute.

  We just replace the style of the =div= with =id= = 'message', with a
  random background color.
* Sample 3: Repeating elements

Repeat a dynamic list of elements.
